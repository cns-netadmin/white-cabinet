The starting point for adding contents to your website is to create a `section`, or a menu content. After creating a section, you can start creating pages and subsections within the section. A `section page` serves as a cushion page to list the contents that belong to that section. This page, for example, is the section page for the `List layout` section.

You can also add date-dependent contents such as conferences, seminars, festivals, etc. An independent page will be devoted to the description of this `post-type` contents, as it requires special treatment.

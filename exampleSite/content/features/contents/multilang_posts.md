For multilingual websites, each page must be duplicated and translated. The file name in the language other than the main language must have the format `<file name>.<language code>.md`. 

For example, this page is written as a file named `multilang_posts.md`. Suppose the main language of the website is English and there is also a Japanese version. In order to create a Japanese version of this page, you need to create a file named `multilang_posts.ja.md` and translate the contents.

Check [Going global]({{< ref "features/build/multilingual" >}}) or the [official Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/) on how to set your website multilingual.

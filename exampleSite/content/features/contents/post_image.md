Images may be inserted into the page with the usual markdown notation:

![Image posted by the usual markdown notation](/img/rabbit2.png)


It is also possible to insert an image using the HTML `img` tag, which requires additional settings in the `config.toml` depending on the markdown parser used. Refer to the corresponding Hugo documentations for this issue.

By default, the figure width is set to 40% of the main section. To override this, you must set the figure size manually using the `img` HTML tag.
